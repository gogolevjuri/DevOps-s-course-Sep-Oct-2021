# About me

My name Juri Gogolev. There I will write are little bit info about me, as my first homework for **Andresen** DevOps courses.
 
### My IT Career history

My IT career starts from middle school when I create my first MMORPG game server(I'm use my own PC as server). In the end of high school I'm already get experience in Linux, web developing, networking, security,etc..
My next step in IT career was still tied up with developing MMORPG game servers, when I'm end school I decided that my game server needed more resources, but as a student I had no free money for this. So i founded a remote job as  support at hosting, where I got a powerful server as payment. This is where I first learned servers monitoring and diagnostic (nagios,zabbix, etc.).
After this I'm found job locally on Internet provider company, based in my town. I work in this company to this day as a system administrator and main developer. I have held this post for over 5 years and got  extensive experience in various areas of the IT knowledge. 
But everyday I still try to learn something new in system administration, networking and development  etc.. This is how I come to **Andresen** DevOps courses.
